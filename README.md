 Practicing PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS

# PHP

Simple way to add dynamic content to the webpage. It can be used to modify HTML, process credit card, add user to a DB, or fetch info from third party site.

```php
Hello World. Today is <?php echo date("1"); ?>. How are you?
```

# MySQL

Used for storing data.

```sql
	INSERT INTO users VALUES('Smith', 'John', 'jsmith@mysite');
```

# JavaScript

JavaScript was developed to offer dynamic control over various elements within an HTML document. It is also used for Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) which is the process of accessing the the web server in the background.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("Hello World. Today is " + Date() );
</script>
```

# CSS

```html
<style>
	p {
		text-align:justify;
		font-family:Helvetica;
	}
</style>
```
